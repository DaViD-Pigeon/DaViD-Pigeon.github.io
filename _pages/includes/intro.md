I am a master student at [College of Computer Science and Technology](http://www.en.cs.zju.edu.cn/), [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), majoring in Computer Science.

Currently I work on the Audio Research Team at Zhejiang University, under the supervision of [Prof. Zhou Zhao](https://person.zju.edu.cn/zhaozhou). Previously I graduated from [Turing Class](http://www.en.cs.zju.edu.cn/turing_honors_class/list.htm), a program established by [Chu Kochen Honors College](ckc.zju.edu.cn), with a bachelor's degree in Artificial Intelligence.

My research interests primarily focus on **Multi-Modal Generative AI**, specifically in **Spatial Audio, Music, Singing, and Speech**. I have published papers at top international AI conference, including NeurIPS, ACL, AAAI and EMNLP. Currently, I am working on **Spatial Audio Generation and Immersive Audio Synthesis**.
